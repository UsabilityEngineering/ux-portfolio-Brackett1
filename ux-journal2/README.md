# My Second Journal Entry: WHy my Microwave is Terrible

## by Anthony Brackett

Microwave ovens are the worst. I mean, I get the appeal. They cook and reheat things quickly, but my problem isn't even with the inconsistent temperature of a microwaved burrito or the fiery hot plate of lukewarm leftover lasagna. Well, maybe it is, but that's another write-up for another time.

My problem is that I literally never use about half of the buttons on it, which is why I'm questioning the **usefulness** or **utility** of the system.

I am honestly not even exagerrating the fact that I do not use *many* of these buttons. I mean just look at them.

It could just be that I'm just not a proficient microwave operator, or that I don't typically go for microwaveable pizzas and dinner plates, but it feels like they were just listing things a microwave *might* be good at cooking. 

I really want to pick on the pause/off button in particular though.

This button has literally 3 useless functions in my opinion. For one, in terms of stopping the microwave while it's cooking, I usually just open the door. I mean you're going to have to open the door to remove whatever you're cooking anyways, so it just seems unnecessary to pause, then turn off the microwave, then open the door. It's not like you're working with a pressure cooker where you have a release valve or something. 

You could argue that it does have a purpose, I'm just choosing not to use it, but I would counter by mentioning the "lock controls" option if you hold this button down for 3 seconds. I would wager that this is not a **useful** feature for the vast majority of users. I'm *guessing* it's meant to keep children or 80 year old grandmas or even pets from unauthorized pizza roll "nuking" but it just doesn't seem like this is necessary and makes you wonder at its **utility**.

The last button on here that I have a problem with is probably the most polarizing, but is more of a general complaint I have from experiences with microwaves. I'm talking about the popcorn button. This button *would* be **useful** if it somehow knew exactly how to cook each bag of popcorn to perfection, but as I shutter in memory of all the times a burnt popcorn smell has offended my senses in an office, cafeteria, or at home, I wish I could share a PSA with everyone that the best way to cook popcorn in this machine is by ear. You just set it for a few minutes and listen for a suspicious break between kernal explosions. It's more of an art than a science and the button is to me encouraging incorrect use and therefore neither **error tolerant** nor **useful**.
