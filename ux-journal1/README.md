# My First Journal Entry
---
Ever since I was a kid, I was always that annoying voice questioning anything and everything, and I really just wanted to understand how things work. It started simple, 
but I truly feel I will always be a lifelong learner, and as I've grown older, a critic of things I feel don't make sense.

In a very non-child like move, I actually bought a new car this last year and it's great! The only thing that frustrates me about it is the interface for the radio,
and I'm going to pick on its **learnabilty** because it deserves it.

So a bit of background, the car is a 2017 Mazda CX-5 and it features an "Infotainment" in-car entertainment system. Basically there's a small screen (larger than most smartphones,
smaller than most laptops) situated in the dash of the car, and it's all controlled by a couple of buttons and what I can only describe as a joystick/dial hybrid.
