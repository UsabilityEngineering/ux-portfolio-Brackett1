# My First Journal Entry

Ever since I was a kid, I was always that annoying voice questioning anything and everything, and I really just wanted to understand how things work. It started simple, but I truly feel I will always be a lifelong learner, and as I've grown older, I've definitely become more critical of things I feel don't make sense.

In a very non-child like move, I actually bought a new car this last year and it's great! The only thing that frustrates me about it is the interface for the radio, and I'm going to pick on its **learnabilty** because honestly, it deserves it.

So a bit of background, the car is a 2017 Mazda CX-5 and it features an "Infotainment" in-car entertainment system. Basically there's a small screen (larger than most smartphones,
but smaller than most laptops) situated in the dash of the car, and it's all controlled by a couple of buttons, a volume knob that you can click to mute the sound, and what I can only describe as a joystick/knob hybrid.

Now to be fully honest, I actually feel pretty comfortable with the system now and it's not that bad after having it a couple months. I have found workarounds to the things I feel could be a lot easier and know the limitations so it is **memorable**, but the whole system feels really foreign to anyone that's used to the usual array of buttons in most cars.

It's really a paradigm shift that takes a while to get on board with and was pretty frustrating at times. The "knobstick" if you will, is basically the main control and allows you to either turn clockwise to go right, and counter-clockwise to go left among the icons on the screen, or to sort of push it like a directional joystick to the left or right, or up and down. The buttons each take you to a different sub-menu as well which make for a convenient, **eficient** shortcut, but from there you still have to click the knobstick like a mouse if you want to select an icon or click a button you have navigated to.

I'm fairly confident that most people would be pretty confused if they sat in the driver seat with no context and decided to listen to some music.

Many people are familiar with steering wheel controls which the car does have (ignore the grossness sorry, it's much worse because of the zoom):

but the "seek" buttons for surfing channels actually only considers stations that you have "favorited" by clicking the star button by the knobstick by default, so it's not really **effective** for a first time user. You have to hold the button to "skip to next good signal" which is pretty slow and it beeps loudly each time. 

There's also that info button in the middle of those two, which does something totally unrelated, and the voice controls I still haven't taken the time to learn. It's a great car but there's some annoying parts for sure that take some time to learn even if someone walks you through it. 

I'll leave you with the annoying warning message the screen displays **every time** you drive it, that must be dismissed before you can really do anything else.
